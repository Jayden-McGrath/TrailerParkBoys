<h1>Richard "Ricky" LaFleur is the French-Canadian resident of Sunnyvale Trailer Park. Ricky's main cohorts are Julian and Bubbles. Lucy who is the mother of Ricky's daughter Trinity. Lucy's second child, Baby Randy, is not Ricky's child, although he did support Lucy to some extent throughout her pregnancy (and her on and off relationship with Randy) he was ultimately given up for adoption as both Lucy and Randy thought it would be best for the child.Ricky is also grandfather to Mo (The Motel), Trinity's child with Jacob Collins, who got named the Motel when Julian bought a motel so that Ricky could live there with Trinity and the baby, who was supposed to be named Ray after Ricky's alleged father, but after Jacob made a mix up with the baby's name and location on the birth certificate papers, was unfortunately named The Motel (Mo for short). Ricky, Julian and Bubbles all grew up in the trailer park together. They have been inexorably tied together ever since.</h1>
